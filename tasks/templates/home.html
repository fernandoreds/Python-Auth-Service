Set mini-deadlines for each step to keep yourself on track.</p>
        <h4>2. Create a Dedicated Study Space</h4>
        <p>Having a dedicated space for studying and completing assignments can help improve your focus and productivity. Make sure your study area is free from distractions, well-lit, and equipped with all the supplies you need, such as pens, paper, and a computer.</p>
        <h4>3. Prioritize Your Tasks</h4>
